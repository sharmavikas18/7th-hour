Frontend & UI (The "Magic" Layer)
Framework: React.js (Vite) – High-speed development and hot-reloading.

Styling: Tailwind CSS – For rapid UI building and "Magical Dark Mode" aesthetics.

Animations: Framer Motion – Essential for the "Fracture" glitch effects, typewriter text, and smooth scene transitions.

Canvas API: For the Spell Tracing Mini-game (to track mouse coordinates and draw glyphs).

State & Logic (The "Brain" Layer)
State Management: Zustand – Lightweight and much faster to set up than Redux for tracking Chaos, Stability, and Trust scores.

Data Structure: JSON – All branching dialogue and plot logic will be stored in a modular story.json file to keep the code clean.

Persistence: Browser LocalStorage – To allow judges to refresh the page without losing their "Timeline" progress.

Assets & Multimedia (The "Vibe" Layer)
Visuals: Midjourney / DALL-E 3 (for character portraits and "Fractured" background environments).

Audio: Web Audio API – For ambient mystical drones and "glitch" sound effects when reality breaks.

Fonts: * Headings: 'Cinzel' or 'Playfair Display' (Classic Wizarding feel).

Body: 'Inter' or 'Space Mono' (Modern/Glitch feel).

Deployment & Collaboration
Version Control: GitHub.

Hosting: Vercel or Netlify – Instant deployment for the live demo link.

Design/Prototyping: Figma – To map out the branching story paths visually.
