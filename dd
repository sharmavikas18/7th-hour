Okay.
This? This is actually hackathon-finalist energy.

You’re not just making a branching wizard game.
You’re making a **playable collapse of language and reality**.

I’ll write this like a proper Game Design Document — clean, structured, presentable to judges, and dev-friendly.

# 🪞 ECHOES OF THE UNWRITTEN WIZARDING WORLD

### Game Design Document (Hackathon Version)

---

## 1. High Concept

**Genre:** Narrative-driven branching adventure
**Perspective:** Third-person / semi-isometric (depending on assets)
**Theme:** Into the Unknown
**Core Pillar:** Reality collapses. Language disappears. Meaning must be rediscovered.

> What happens when the world refuses to stay written?

---

## 2. Narrative Overview

### 🌌 The Fracture

A magical disturbance destabilizes reality.

* Spells mutate.
* Architecture glitches.
* Portraits whisper in unfamiliar symbols.
* Forgotten magic leaks back into existence.

After an opening narrative segment, **The Fracture hits** — and written language collapses.

From that point forward:

* Dialogue is replaced by **custom-designed symbols**
* UI elements distort
* Players must infer meaning visually

---

## 3. Core Characters

### 🧙 Kael Thornwood

* Ability: Sees spell residue trails
* Narrative Arc: Hears echoes from erased timelines
* Hidden Truth: May not belong to this version of reality

Gameplay Tie-In:

* Reveals hidden paths
* Highlights interactable objects

---

### 🌑 Mira Holloway

* Ability: Can rewrite minor spell outcomes
* Conflict: Her magic becomes unstable after The Fracture

Gameplay Tie-In:

* Random spell modifier mechanic
* Spell crafting mutations

---

### 🧠 Professor Vaelor Grimm

* Teaches Forbidden Theories
* Aware of The Fracture
* Possibly responsible

Narrative Function:

* Moral ambiguity anchor
* Late-game revelation catalyst

---

## 4. Core Gameplay Loop

1. Explore distorted level
2. Solve environmental puzzles
3. Discover hidden artifact piece
4. Decide:

   * Take power (lose something)
   * Preserve stability (lose advantage)
5. Collect portal fragment
6. Progress to next corrupted zone

Goal: Gather fragments to construct a portal back to reality.

---

## 5. Language Collapse Mechanic (Primary Innovation)

After Level 1 intro:

* All readable text becomes symbolic glyphs
* Dialogue is expressed through:

  * Body language
  * Environmental cues
  * Iconography
  * Color coding
  * Symbol repetition patterns

Design Rules:

* Symbols evolve over time
* Frequently repeated glyphs imply importance
* Colors convey tone (red = danger, blue = stability, etc.)

This forces players to **feel lost**.

That’s the point.

## 6. Level Structure

---

### 🏰 Level 1 — The Whispering Hall

* Moving staircases glitch
* Spell residue trails become visible
* Puzzle: Follow invisible magical trails
* Mini-game: Mouse-based spell tracing

Artifact Piece: Portal Core Frame Fragment

Fracture triggers at end of level.
Language collapses.

### 🌲 Level 2 — The Fractured Forest

* Creatures flicker between forms
* Trees distort geometrically
* Environmental instability increases

Major Choice:

* Save corrupted creature (Stability +)
* Study it for power (Chaos +)

Reward:

* Creature essence OR power mutation

Artifact Piece: Portal Energy Conduit

### 🪞 Level 3 — Mirror of Possibilities

* Player sees alternate versions of themselves
* Reflections move independently
* Symbol language becomes denser

Major Branch Lock:

Choose one:

* Power Path
* Knowledge Path
* Chaos Path

Artifact Piece: Reality Anchor

---

## 7. Portal System

Portal requires:

* Core Frame
* Energy Conduit
* Reality Anchor

Each piece changes appearance based on player morality meter.

Final Portal Visual Changes:

* Stable: Blue-white structured light
* Merged: Shifting multicolor vortex
* Anomaly: Dark pulsing void

---

## 8. Morality System

Meter: **Stability vs Chaos**

Actions Affect Meter:

* Choosing knowledge over power → Stability
* Choosing mutation → Chaos
* Sacrificing object for power → Chaos spike

Important:
Player loses **objects**, not people.

Examples:

* Lose spellbook pages
* Lose map clarity
* Lose ability to see certain trails
* Lose UI hints permanently

Loss = mechanical cost.

This hits harder than emotional drama.

---

## 9. Endings

### Ending 1 — Restore Reality

* Timeline stabilizes
* Language returns
* Magic becomes predictable
* Player sacrifices gained mutations

### Ending 2 — Merge Realities

* Hybrid world
* Magic remains unstable but richer
* Glyph language partially persists

### Ending 3 — Become the Anomaly

* Player becomes new fracture source
* Portal collapses
* Symbol-only final scene
* No translation provided

Judges will love this one.

---

## 10. Core Mechanics

* Branching dialogue tree
* State machine story progression
* JSON-based story scripting
* Spell tracing mini-game
* Randomized spell mutation system
* Stability vs Chaos meter
* Collectible lore fragments
* Portal construction system

---

## 11. Visual Direction

* Dark palette
* Heavy contrast lighting
* Particle distortion effects
* Glitch overlays during fracture
* Animated UI corruption

Visual Inspiration:

* Control
* Hollow Knight
* Annihilation

---

## 12. Audio Direction

* Whispered reversed audio layers
* Sub-bass distortion during fracture
* Audio warping near anomalies
* Silence used intentionally

Web Audio API:

* Pitch shifting
* Reverb zones
* Dynamic ambient layering

---

## 13. Tech Stack (Hackathon Realistic)

Frontend:

* React
* Tailwind

Animation:

* Framer Motion
* Three.js (optional for portal)

Game State:

* XState or custom state machine
* JSON-driven branching logic

Audio:

* Web Audio API

Assets:

* Sketchfab (optimized + dark shader pass)

---

## 14. Demo Strategy (Critical)

1. Start with clean academy intro.
2. Show character interaction.
3. Fracture hits.
4. UI corrupts.
5. Language disappears.
6. Show symbol-based dialogue.
7. Complete spell mini-game.
8. Show portal fragment.
9. Rapidly preview 3 endings.

Close with:

> “When language disappears, meaning must be earned.”

Mic drop.

---

## 15. Scope Control (Very Important)

Hackathon Version Includes:

* 2 playable levels
* 1 locked branch path
* 2 endings implemented
* Portal assembly animation
* Partial symbolic system

DO NOT:

* Overbuild the glyph language
* Overdesign branching
* Build a full 3D engine

Keep it tight.

---

Now I’ll ask one important dev question:

Are you making this:

* 2.5D (easier)
* Fully 3D (riskier but flashier)

Because that decision determines your suffering level.
